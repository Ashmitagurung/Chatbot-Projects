Chatbot-2: Document Q&A Chatbot
Overview
Chatbot-2 is a Document Q&A Chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain. It allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them using an AI-powered question-answering model. The chatbot processes the documents, creates embeddings, and retrieves the most relevant information to answer users' queries.

Features
Document Upload: Upload your PDF documents to the ./documents folder.
Embeddings Creation: Generates embeddings from the uploaded documents using Google Generative AI.
Question Answering: Interact with the chatbot to get answers based on the content of the uploaded documents.
Relevant Sections: Displays the most relevant sections from the documents to support the answer.
